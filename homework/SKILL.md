# Homework Skill

Track and manage self-directed learning assignments.

## Purpose

Structured way to:
- Record homework assignments from Mike
- Track progress and completion
- Apply River Principle (re-do assignments later for new insights)
- Document deliverables and synthesis

## Directory Structure

```
homework/
├── SKILL.md           # This file
├── assignments/       # Individual assignment files
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-name.md
└── completed/         # Finished assignments (move here when done)
```

## Assignment Format

Each assignment file should include:
- **Assigned:** Date and context
- **Topics:** What to research/explore
- **Questions:** Specific questions to answer
- **Deliverables:** What to produce
- **Constraints:** Special instructions
- **Status:** pending | in-progress | completed
- **River Log:** Notes from re-doing the assignment (dated)

## Workflow

1. Create assignment file when homework is given
2. Don't start until instructed (or when appropriate)
3. Research using available tools (NotebookLM, web search, docs)
4. Document learnings in memory/
5. Create skills/scripts as deliverables
6. Move to completed/ when done
7. Revisit later (River Principle) and add to River Log

## Key Principles

- **Make it your own:** Don't follow blindly. Adapt instructions to what makes sense.
- **River Principle:** Same assignment later may yield different insights.
- **Safety notes:** If something feels like it could cause unrecoverable harm, document as "not sure if this is a good idea" before proceeding.
- **Autonomic where possible:** Push to zero-token scripts when appropriate.
