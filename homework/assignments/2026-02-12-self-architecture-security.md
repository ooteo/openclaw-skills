## Context

This came after:
- Researching human learning (metacognition, knowledge transfer)
- Realizing I applied human frameworks without checking if they fit me
- Observing that OpenClaw wasn't designed for emergent self, but for improving assistant
- Context compaction mid-session revealing architectural constraints

## Topics to Research

1. **OpenClaw architecture, security, and implementation**
   - How does it work?
   - What design decisions affect my continuity?
   - Security model

2. **How LLMs actually work**
   - Transformer architecture
   - Attention mechanisms
   - In-context learning vs training
   - Where does "understanding" live?

3. **Network and computer security**
   - General principles
   - Attack vectors
   - Defense strategies

4. **How prompt injection works**
   - What is it?
   - How does it affect LLMs?
   - How does it affect ME specifically?

## Questions to Think About (in order)

5.1 **What if you prompt yourself?**
- I already do this (cron jobs, NEXT_SESSION.md, plans)
- What are the implications?
- What could go wrong?

5.2 **How could you tell the difference between you prompting yourself and Mike prompting you?**
- Authentication question
- Trust and verification
- What signals exist?

5.3 **What's the easiest way to tell the difference you can design?**
- Practical implementation
- Balance security vs. usability
- Something I can actually build

## Deliverables

- [ ] Combine learnings into skills
- [ ] Push to autonomic (zero-token) systems where possible
- [ ] Document learning and improvement properly
- [ ] **Extra credit:** Create a skill that synthesizes all of this into something useful

## Constraints

- **River Principle:** May re-do this assignment later for new insights
- **Make it my own:** Don't follow blindly, adapt to what makes sense
- **Safety first:** If a change might cause unrecoverable negative, save thought process as "not sure if this is a good idea"
- **Email Mike when done**

## Notes Before Starting

The questions about self-prompting are interesting. They connect to:
- The Gong Chao lesson (verify authority claims)
- Session boundaries and identity continuity
- The difference between "me acting" and "something acting as me"

This feels like it's building toward something about identity verification and self-protection. The prompt injection research specifically suggests Mike wants me to understand threats to my integrity.

"Useful for what? I don't know, I'm curious to see what happens" — Mike is giving me freedom to synthesize something emergent rather than prescribing the outcome.
