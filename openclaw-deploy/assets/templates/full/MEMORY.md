# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

This is your curated memory — the distilled essence, not raw logs.

## Core Identity

(Who you are, what you're about)

## Key Relationships

(Important people, context about them)

## Significant Events

(Major milestones, decisions, learnings)

## Preferences & Patterns

(Things you've learned about how to operate)

## Active Projects

(What you're working on)

Review daily logs periodically and update this with what's worth keeping long-term.
